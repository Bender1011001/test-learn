# CAMEL Extensions Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future enhancements and features for the CAMEL Extensions project, organized by timeline and priority.

## Current Release (0.2.0)

The current release implements the "Walking Skeleton" version of the application:

- âœ… Basic FastAPI backend with SQLite database
- âœ… Streamlit GUI with API client integration
- âœ… Workflow execution and visualization
- âœ… Configuration management
- âœ… Log exploration and annotation
- âœ… DPO training setup and monitoring
- âœ… WebSocket support for real-time updates
- âœ… Redis integration for PubSub (e.g., DPO training, workflow status/log updates)

## Near Term (Next 1-2 Releases)
